# SwapifyAndroidApp
### Swapify is an Android Mobile Application that takes your playlists from Spotify and swaps each song in the playlist with another song from the same artist and album! This application aims to keep your playlist fresh and invigorating with the tap of a button. We also offer the ability to swap individual songs in a playlist if you are only tired of hearing a few songs in your playlist. Once you happen to find the right playlist, you could go ahead and save the new generated playlist, if you would like to keep the new one. 

### Spotify is known for not having a very functional shuffle button for randomizing songs in a playlist. The shuffle button should allow you to mix up the order of the songs of your playlist in a way that the playlist stays fresh, but it seems that the same songs usually play over and over. There is another problem of adding whole albums to a playlist and creating a massive bloated playlist. Our application solves these problems by swapping songs and keeping playlists original and efficient.
